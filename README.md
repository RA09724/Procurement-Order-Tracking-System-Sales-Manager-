# Procurement-Order-Tracking-System-Sales-Manager-Interface

This repository contains the code for a Java-based group project focused on creating a Procurement Order Tracking System (POTS). Specifically, I developed the Sales Manager interface, which utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage various sales-related tasks within the system.

The Sales Manager interface includes the following key functionalities:

Inventory Checks: View and manage the stock of products in the inventory.

Requisition Forms: Generate and manage requisition forms for purchase orders.

Purchase Orders: Handle purchase order creation and tracking.

Daily Sales Entry: Record daily sales transactions for tracking and reporting.

Automated Sales Report Generation: Generate detailed sales reports, including charts and summaries, for sales performance analysis.
